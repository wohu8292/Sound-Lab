I've sampled hammond organ by using the line out into my computer.
I've used lower keyboard for low frequency and upper keyboard for high frequency

--------------------
sample directly from hammond organ
--------------------

original sound before adding effect.wav
(0~5s) vibrato on lower frequency / no vibrato on high frequency
(6~8s) turn off the vibrato on lower frequency
(9~12s) vibrato on high frequency / no vibrato on low frequency
(13~18s) manipulate level of output
(19~32) manipulate drawbar
(33~) chorus?
