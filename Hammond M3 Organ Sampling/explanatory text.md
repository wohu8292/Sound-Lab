I've sampled hammond organ by using the line out into my computer.
I've used lower keyboard for low frequency and upper keyboard for high frequency

--------------------
original sound before adding effect.wav
--------------------

(-5s) vibrato on lower frequency / no vibrato on high frequency
(-8s) turn off the vibrato on lower frequency
(-12s) vibrato on high frequency / no vibrato on low frequency
(-18s) manipulate level of output
(-32s) manipulate drawbar
(-33s) chorus?

--------------------
Hammond M3 Organ Sampling.wav
--------------------

(8-12s) spectural resonator
(-17s) adding some noise using vocoder
(21) increased amount of delay effect slowly
